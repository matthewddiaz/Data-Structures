# Fundamental Data Structures

## Stack
Is a dynamic set that only allows removal of the key most recently inserted.
That is LIFO (Last In, First Out)
  

### [Stack](https://github.com/matthewddiaz/Data-Structures/blob/master/src/com/matthewddiaz/datastructures/stack/StackList.java)
Stack.java is implemented by using chained Nodes, however it can also be implemented using
and array. If the Stack is implemented using an array then its size is bound by the size 
of the array.

Operations of Stack

1) **void push(T key)** - inserts key to the top of the Stack. 

    **Time Complexity:** Θ(1)

2) **T pop()** - removes and returns the top most key of the Stack.
    If the Stack is empty returns null.

   **Time Complexity:** Θ(1)
